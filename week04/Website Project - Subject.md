## Automated Calling Logs Platform
This simple platform will inform the user about the automated calls made by the company's calling robot. The user will be able to search by the call ID or get a list of errors grouped by date, error message, client, or campaign ID.

### Reason
I noticed that in the company I work for, there is no platform that allows us to search for the calls made by the calling robot. I'm planning to develop a REST API to gather all this information at work. This project will focus only on the features of the platform and the user experience. The API data will be mocked in JSON files or JavaScript objects.
